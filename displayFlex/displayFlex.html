        <div>So, this single declaration gives us everything we need. Incredible, right? We have our multiple column
            layout with equal-sized columns, and the columns are all the same height. This is because the default values
            given to flex items (the children of the flex container) are set up to solve common problems such as this.

            To be clear, let's reiterate what is happening here. The element we've given a display value of flex to is
            acting like a block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but its children
            are laid out as flex items. The next section will explain in more detail what this means. Note also that you
            can use a display value of inline-flex if you wish to lay out an element's children as flex</div>
