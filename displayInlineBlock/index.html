                <p>To be clear, let's reiterate what is happening here. The element we've given a display value of flex
                    to is acting like a block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but
                    its children are laid out as flex items. The next section will explain in more detail what this
                    means. Note also that you can use a display value of inline-flex if you wish to lay out an element's
                    children as flex items, but have that element behave like an inline element.</p>
